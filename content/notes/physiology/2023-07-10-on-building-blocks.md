In which we learn that some biological LEGO bricks are stickier than others... and once some of them are stuck together we might as well assume they’re stuck forever.

<!-- excerpt -->

At this stage, though, we’re learning our metaphorical ABCs. You have to know the ABCs before you get to the magic of using them to read and write sentences. In physiological terms, that means we have to learn about the basic molecules in order to understand how these molecules interact with and potentially change each other. No matter how much we might want to skip learning these ABCs, we can’t read and write without them.

## Sharing

> **share (n.)**
> from the Old English *scearu*
> “a cutting, shearing, tonsure;
> a part or division, a piece cut off”

Let’s start with atoms, which are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons are vital to biological functions.

* They can be shared between atoms to create a molecule with covalent bonds.
* They can be gained or lost by an atom or molecule, which then acquires a charge and becomes an ion. Ions with opposite charge attract each other and form noncovalent bonds. Ions are also used for electrical signaling in the body.
* They can sometimes capture, store, and release energy—these are called high-energy electrons. And when molecules have an additional unpaired electron, these are called free radicals. Free radicals and high-energy electrons are thought to contribute to aging and certain diseases.

In the formation of molecules, there are two types of bonds: noncovalent and covalent bonds.

* Noncovalent bonds require less energy to make or break, and therefore facilitate reversible interactions. These are primarily ionic bonds.
* Covalent bonds require more energy to make or break than noncovalent bonds, and the resulting molecules are polar or nonpolar. Forever chemicals, for example, are “forever” because they contain many carbon-fluorine bonds, which are the strongest bonds that form and the hardest ones to break.
  * Polar molecules do not share electrons evenly between the atoms. Since the electron isn’t shared evenly, the atom(s) that attracts electrons develops a slightly negative charge and the other atom(s) develops a slightly positive charge. A common example of a polar molecule is water. Oxygen is a bit of an electron hog and develops a partial negative charge. The net charge of molecule itself, however, is zero.^[A distinction worth noting here is that a single water molecule is the result of covalent bonds between its hydrogen atoms and oxygen atom, but the bonds that hold multiple water molecules together are noncovalent hydrogen bonds, where the slight positively charged hydrogen atoms are weakly attracted to other molecules’ slightly negatively charged oxygen atoms.]
  * Nonpolar molecules share electrons evenly, with no part of the molecule developing any partial charge. Carbons and hydrogens tend to share their electrons evenly. These nonpolar molecules tend to be hydrophobic because they have no charge with which to bond to the positive or negative ends of water and therefore, don’t dissolve in water.

## Biomolecules

> **molecule (n.)**
> from the French *molécule*
> “extremely minute particle”

There are four biomolecules (molecules associated with living organisms):

* Lipids
  * mostly carbon and hydrogen
  * fats, which are solid at room temperature (and usually derive from animals)
  * oils, which are liquid at room temperature (and usually derive from plants)
* Carbohydrates
  * mostly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
* Proteins
  * contain nitrogen in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
* Nucleotides
  * DNA and RNA are components of genetic material
  * ATP carry energy and cyclic AMP regular metabolism

Lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins all provide our bodies with energy.^[Not all biomolecules in the body are purely one of these four, however. There are molecules called lipoproteins, which are lipids combined with proteins, hence the name. Other common combinations are glycoproteins and glycolipids (glycosylated molecules are ones with an attached carbohydrate).] They also all make an appearance on packaged foods as Fat (and Cholesterol), Carbohydrate, and Protein, respectively. Different countries require different breakdowns of constituent elements. Vitamins and minerals (which are listed on some nutrition labels) also play a role in the functioning of proteins.

## Proteins

> **protein (n.)**^[“Protein” was used alongside “proteid” until 1907 when a scientific committee convened to sort out the nomenclature, giving protein its modern meaning and ousting proteid.]
> perhaps from the Greek *prōteios*
> “the first quality”

Let’s dive deeper into one of those now. Proteins are important to many cell functions in our bodies, and predictably, take part in many reversible interactions using noncovalent (reversible) molecular bonding. Broadly, proteins act as:

* enzymes: catalysts, which speed up chemical reactions
* membrane transporters: proteins in cell membranes aid in moving substances across the border between the inside of the cell (intracellular compartment) and the outside of the cell (extracellular compartment)
* signal molecules: acting as hormones and in other “messenger” roles
* receptors: proteins that bind to signal molecules and initiate cellular responses
* binding proteins: mostly in the extracellular fluid, these pick up and move molecules throughout the body
* immunoglobulins: otherwise known as antibodies
* regulatory proteins: these turn cell processes on and off

### Fit

All proteins require molecular complementarity, which means that proteins bind to molecules or ions selectively. How selective they are depends on the protein. Some do not need to fit the shape of its ligand (the molecule or ion that binds to it) perfectly since a protein can change its shape as it comes into proximity with the ligand through an intricate dance of noncovalent (reversible) bonds. However, not only do proteins require molecular complementarity, they also require the right context—the right combination of chemical and physical factors.

### Physical Conditions

The physical conditions include temperature and pH (amount of hydrogen ions present in the surrounding fluid). Small changes can increase or decrease activity, but there are critical values where they disrupt the noncovalent bonds holding the protein into the right shape to bond with its ligands. When this happens, the protein becomes denatured. When you fry an egg, which changes the temperature, the transformation of the egg white in the pan from a goopy clear fluid to a white solid is the denaturing of the protein albumin. When you make ceviche and marinate raw fish in lime juice (or some other acid with a high enough concentration of hydrogen ions, therefore changing the pH), the transformation of the muscle proteins of the fish denatures as well. Denaturing is irreversible (how would you un-fry an egg or uncook ceviche?).

### Chemical Influences

Besides changes in the physical conditions surrounding the protein, the activity of proteins can be altered with chemical modulators—other molecules—that alter their ability to bind. Some proteins must be activated: They will not bind without a cofactor (an ion or specific molecules with specific groups of atoms—called functional groups). Others require parts to be snipped off or removed by other proteins in order to become active. Some modulators can inactivate a protein, reversibly or irreversibly. Antagonists, which are also called inhibitors, are modulators that bind to a protein and thereby limit other ligands from binding to the protein. These can also bind—you guessed it—reversibly or irreversibly.

### Concentration

The final method the body uses to regulate protein activity is by making more protein (called up-regulation) or breaking down and removing protein (called down-regulation). The amount of protein present has a direct influence over the intensity of the body’s response.

Whew. That was a lot. We have learned a bit about how atoms interact to form molecules (noncovalent—reversible—and covalent—harder to reverse—bonds), which influences how molecules can interact with each other (nonpolar molecules—like fat or oil—tend not to be soluble because water is polar). We learned about the four primary biomolecules, of which we focused on proteins. Proteins have many different roles in the body and their activity can be changed through a variety of methods.

We’re going to zoom out a little in the upcoming chapter. Next up is understanding the cell membrane and how proteins play a role in their structure and function.
