A brief overview of what is happening within the physical body.
<!-- excerpt -->

Outside of a 200-hour yoga teacher training, this is my first foray into understanding the physical, biological, body and trying to draw connections to what I’m calling the socialized body (the human being who is subject to the influence of society, culture, philosophy, and more). My yoga teacher training was like many others, where the time constraints of a 200-hour program meant learning about the musculoskeletal system took precedence over the rest of the organ systems. But the reality is that every organ system has a role to play in movement—yogic or otherwise—despite appearing to be governed only by the musculoskeletal system.

## Principles

> **principle (n.)**
> from the Latin *principium*
> “beginning, origin, source”

There are a handful of major focal points that educational organizations agree are important in the study of biology:
* structure and function across all levels of organization (from atoms all the way to the biosphere)
* energy transfer, storage, and use
* information flow, storage, and use within single organisms and within a species of organism
* homeostasis and the control systems that maintain it
* evolution

This physiology textbook focuses on the first four, omitting evolution. Associated with those four themes are more specific principles to learn:
* Structure and function are closely related.
* Living organisms need energy.
* Information flow coordinates bodily functions.
* Homeostasis maintains internal stability.

The first three principles will be explored in the coming chapters. We’ll dive into how the body maintains internal stability, and what internal stability means, now.

## Homeostasis

> **homeostasis (n.)**
> from the Greek *homoios* “like”
> and the Greek *stasis* “standing, stoppage”

Homeostasis is the state where the body is able to function in the midst of changes, both internal and external. Despite the implications of the suffix -stasis, this state is a dynamic steady state of disequilibrium. Let’s break that down:

* It is dynamic because there is a constant exchange of substances across compartments.
* It is steady because there is no net change in those substances over time.
* Disequilibrium tells us that the goal here is not equal amounts of any substance in the various compartments within the body, instead, the goal is more of some substances and less of others, differing from one compartment to another.

## Systems

> **system (n.)**
> from the Late Latin *system*
> “an arrangement”
> and the Greek *systema*
> ”organized whole”

The body is comprised of interconnected organ systems. Every system monitors variables, for example, substance load (the amount of a substance in the body, like oxygen or water), and makes adjustments with physiological mechanisms, called loops, to return those variables to an optimum value, called a setpoint.

The process begins with a stimulus, which triggers a response loop with three components: (1) an input signal, (2) a controller (called an integrating center), and (3) an output signal. The integrating center can either be a local control or a long-distance reflex control. In mammals, like humans, reflex control uses the nervous system, endocrine system, or both.

But the response loop is just the beginning. What follows is one of two types of feedback loops: Loops that work toward homeostasis or loops that don’t.

* A loop that works toward homeostasis, whose goal is to return the variable to its previous value before the stimulus, thereby reducing, eliminating, or reversing the impact of the stimulus, is called a negative feedback loop.
* The other type of loop seeks to reinforce and build on the stimulus and is called a positive feedback loop. These require external intervention to stop the loop from continuing.

To remember the difference, I think about negative feedback loops as loops that negate the effect of the stimulus. Positive feedback loops add more change to the variable until something else stops it.

## Illness

> **ill (adj.)**
> from the Old Norse *illr*
> “evil, bad; hard, difficult; stingy”
> and *-ness*
> which denotes a quality or state,
> used with an adjective

When the body is unable to compensate and return to ranges where the body can function, we become citizens of the “kingdom of the sick.”

> Illness is the night side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.
<cite>Susan Sontag, “Illness as Metaphor”</cite>

Those persistent disruptions to homeostasis are called pathological conditions or disease states. They are categorized according to their origins: internal causes and external causes.

* Internal causes originate from failure in normal physiological processes, like abnormal cell growth, which may cause tumors and cancer (as it did in my father).
* External causes include toxins, viruses, bacteria, and physical trauma.

While the body is in a disease state, the impact can be seen in many systems of the body, further emphasizing the integrative nature of physiology. In addition, what Sontag’s quote reminds me is that illness not only impacts the physical body, it also impacts the socialized body and how we interact in society.

## Zoom In

> **zoom (v.)**
> of echoic origin (from imitating a sound)
> popularized by aviators in the early 1900s

We study ourselves at various levels of resolution, zooming into the level of atoms and molecules and zooming out to the level of the entire population, the ecosystem, and the biosphere… and everything in between. A peek into the next chapter, and what’s next in this series, reveals that we’ll start small, smaller than the human eye can perceive, with molecules.

Understanding what is happening at the molecular level reveals the mechanisms of metabolism, the various ways the body uses substances, and what drives those feedback loops that help us maintain homeostasis. Like getting to know the shape and capabilities of Lego bricks, we will be getting to know the molecules within us and how they can interact.
