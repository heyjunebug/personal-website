An introduction to my project—an attempt to answer the question, “What does it mean to be sick?” from a physiological standpoint.
<!-- excerpt -->

My interest in physiology is personal. In mid-April 2023, my mother called and explained that my father had been rushed into emergency surgery to remove a mass from his colon. The procedure evolved into a colostomy when it was deemed too risky to proceed with removal. The diagnosis was colon cancer and the result of the surgery, a stoma and a man-made system that allows for bypassing the blocked portion of the colon.

## Diagnosis

> **diagnosis (n.)** 
> from the Greek stem *diagignōskein* 
> “discern, distinguish,” 
> literally “to know thoroughly”

Since the diagnosis, I’ve spent my days asking my husband, a soon-to-be chiropractor, to explain the basics of how the body works. I’ve begun to realize how little I know about something I’ve been interacting with since birth (35 years ago)—something that will be with me until I die (whenever that is). Knowledge doesn’t accumulate without effort. My parents have lived much longer, and they have even less understanding of how the body works than I do, when they probably need it most. Add in the barrier of being non-native English speakers, and it has fallen to me to translate^[Here, what I mean when I say “translate” is “simplify without losing relevant information in the process,” not “express the words or ideas from one language in another.”] what the doctors have explained when it comes to lab results and prognosis.

Amongst friends, I’ve long talked about my dedication to continuing education and my thirst for knowledge when it comes to the intricate art and science of being human in a modern world. My interests span academic subjects like philosophy, sociology, and cognitive science to spiritual practices like astrology and tarot to the enormous umbrella that is “health and wellness.” To those around me, teaching myself human physiology from a textbook is right up my alley.

The textbook I chose is “Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach” by Dee Unglaub Silverthorn, and I chose it for a couple of reasons.

The keyword in the subtitle, “integrated,” implies a more holistic view of the human body and how it functions. That emphasis on integration, according to the front matter, comes in the form of three chapters that focus on how multiple organ systems work together to maintain homeostasis.^[Homeostasis is not to be confused with equilibrium, as we’ll see in the next part of this series where I’ll dive into Chapter 1 (Introduction to Physiology).]

The text is in its 8th edition. There’s a voice in the back of my mind telling me that textbooks that make it into multiple editions tend to do so because they are widely used and well-regarded—who planted that idea and when are both lost to the march of time.

## Integration

> **integration (n.)**
> from Late Latin *integrationem*,
> the noun of action from the
> past participle stem integrare
> “to make whole,” also “renew, begin again”

What I aspire to is a deeper understanding and appreciation of the connectedness and complexity of the systems at work on and in the body. I’ll do what I don’t remember ever doing in my life before: I’ll read the textbook from start to finish and write something that is part-summary and part-commentary for every chapter. Since there are 26 chapters, and I’m committing to a fortnightly (releasing something every two weeks) publishing schedule, I’ll finish this project a year from now.

If you choose to follow along, I hope you’ll learn a bit about your body and how it works as well as how your body might differ from mine or someone else’s. I hope you’ll even join me in vowing to care for yourself as if this were a traditional marriage, “in sickness and in health.” After all, we have just this one body, for better or for worse, “’til death do us part.”
