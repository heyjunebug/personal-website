If a puzzle were to take book form, it might look like this. Anyone who has completed a jigsaw puzzle will recognize this book's particular energy: The book gains momentum and speed as more and more pieces click into place, until, finally, the whole picture becomes clear.

It is difficult to write about the book without giving away the satisfaction of experiencing the reveal from start to finish. "Sea of Tranquility," at its heart, is a story about how individual's actions—intentional and otherwise—change the course of reality. It reminds me that actions and their impact ripple through time and jostle the lives of others... others we could never account for.

It is a puzzle you will want to return to, to see how breadcrumbs were laid out for you to follow. My guess is that a second read would reveal even more than the first, and that every subsequent read would leave a different impression. This is a book for those who like to dig into their stories more than once, revisiting them over time as they themselves change and are changed.
