This book left a lasting impression, and months later, I still think about it. It sparked a new and persistent pastime: looking up the etymology of words.

I have composed many sentences in my mind about this book since finishing it in late January/early February (based on the dates logged with my highlights on my Kobo Libra H2O). It’s rare that a book leaves an impression deep enough that I still think about it seven months later—*very* rare. This is my first attempt to make those imaginary sentences real... to translate the vague impressions left by the experience of losing myself the alternate Oxford University of “Babel” into something more tangible.  

> ...the Latin *translatio* means to “carry across”. Translation involves a spatial dimension—a literal transporation of texts across conquered territory, words delivered like spices from an alien land. Words mean something quite different when they journey from the palaces of Rome to the tearooms of today’s Britain.
<cite>Professor Playfair (Babel, Chapter 6)</cite>

The story is about a child, Robin, displaced from his homeland after his mother dies from cholera. British Professor Lovell offers him a more comfortable life in London, where he will train to enroll in Oxford University’s Royal Institute of Translation, known as Babel. Within Babel’s walls, the magic of this world is guarded closely. Enchanted bars of silver manifest the gaps in meaning between words in different languages.

There are many themes threaded throughout, some of which you might guess from the rest of the book’s title and subtitle, “or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translator’s Revolution”: racism, colonialism, language, identity, social change, and belonging. 

This book pushed all the right buttons for me. Page-turning action and revelations with characters that felt alive to me—real enough that I saw shades of people I’ve known, past and present. Plenty of footnotes with interesting linguistic asides. I loved it enough I hunted down R.F. Kuang’s other books—“Yellowface”^[I’ll be writing an impression for this one in the coming weeks, too. It consumed me just as “Babel” did, but for very different reasons.] and “The Poppy War” series.^[I have read just the first so far. It is well-written, but intense. War isn’t something I enjoy reading about, and Kuang’s writing is so vivid that this book is *good* but not pleasurable to read. I do intend on reading the rest of the series at some point, though.]

This was my first of her books, and after thoroughly enjoying this book and “Yellowface,” I am certain I will always make time to read Kuang’s future releases.

## Highlights
<div class="highlights">

* So you see, translators do not so much deliver a message as they rewrite the original. And herein lies the difficulty – rewriting is still writing, and writing always reflects the author’s ideology and biases. After all, the Latin *translatio* means “to carry across”. Translation involves a spatial dimension – a literal transportation of texts across conquered territory, words delivered like spices from an alien land. Words mean something quite different when they journey from the palaces of Rome to the tearooms of today’s Britain.

* ...we must proceed from the starting assumption that distortion is inevitable. The question is how to distort with deliberation.

* Tytler recommends three basic principles... ‘First, that the translation conveys a complete and accurate idea of the original,’ said Victoire. ‘Second, that the translation mirrors the style and manner of writing of the original. And third, that the translation should read with all the ease of the original composition.’

* Theory comes from the Greek *theōria*, meaning a sight or spectacle, whose root also gives us the word theatre.
