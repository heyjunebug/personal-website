I’ve always hated hard questions because I have always wanted to have <em>the right answer</em>. Perhaps it’s because I spent more than a decade identifying as a good student. And we all know that a good student has good grades because they know all the right answers. 

<!-- excerpt -->

Ironically, it's this mindset that cripples you after you are no longer a student enrolled in an educational institution. The obsession with the *right* answer will paralyze you if you let it.

The right answer isn't the point. The point is the conversation. The conversation is where the magic happens. The conversation is the playground that allows you to engage deeply with others (or yourself). The conversation is the testing ground for you to reflect on what you *do* know *and* what you don't. Hard questions offer you something valuable. If you can let go of searching for the *right* answer, you'll find that opportunities and growth await you on the other side.
