There’s a power to accepting reality as it is. When you no longer invest your energy in denial and frustration, you’ll find yourself free: free to invest in working within the constraints (or if you prefer, working creatively despite the constraints). 

<!-- excerpt -->

If you find yourself asking, “How do I know which constraints I need to accept?” you already know the answer. You’ve been fighting it. You’ve been talking about wishing the world was different—*better*. This is futile. Accept the constraint and either work within it or work on changing it, grounded in what *is* and not just what *could be*. There is very little that is more crippling than repeated exercises in futility. What some might call “quitting” is actually acceptance. When you quit fighting reality, we—the change makers—will be waiting for you on the other side.
