Five experiments to diversify stale sentences, from the book “25 Great Sentences and How They Got That Way,” with examples.

<!-- excerpt -->

## **1. Condense.**
### Distill your idea to its essence.

Eliminate everything unnecessary.

> Make your point. Emphatically.

## **2. Expand.**
### Add description for a more detailed picture.

Invite your readers—
those lovers of rhythm and words,
those lovers of metaphor and imagery,
those lovers of taking the road less traveled,
*your* lovers—on a strol.

> To teleport your reader somewhere new, you need detail.

## **3. Repeat.**
### Use parallelism to emphasize or surprise.

Repetition can provide better context.
Repetition can draw the reader in.
Repetition can emphasize a point.
Repetition in large quantities can also induce sleep.

> Create a pattern, then break it to surprise your reader.

## **4. Contradict.**
### Tell them how it *isn’t*, then tell them how it is.

The goal shouldn't be learning to write, it should be writing to learn.

> This framework will help you challenge conventional thought.

## **5. Focus on Absence.**
### It can be useful to focus on nothingness, instead of not focusing on anything.

There's a subtle difference:
"Infrequent writers will gain no subscribers."
"Infrequent writers will not gain subscribers."

> Never experimenting will get you nowhere.
