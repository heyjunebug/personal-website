Why uncertainty makes us uncomfortable, some myths about uncertainty, and how to deal with it...
<!-- excerpt -->

### How Uncertainty Impacts Us
As I curate my thoughts, I’m struck by the irony that I’m uncertain about the best way to collect my thoughts on uncertainty into something resembling a cohesive whole. Similar to how shame and vulnerability are taboo, even the acknowledgment of uncertainty makes me cringe and assume the fetal position. I recently listened to the Art of Charm podcast, episode 630, which offers some strategies for living with uncertainty.

Our brains are incredible prediction machines that benefit from gathering more data and attempting to find more and more accurate patterns and information to increase our chances of survival—to increase our stability in life. 

> Uncertainty arises from the gap between how much information our brains want and how much information we actually have. In addition, our brains have no regard for whether the information is actually available or necessary at this moment.

One important thing we need to remember is how much of life we’ve gotten through so far with limited information. Uncertainty isn’t inherently paralyzing, it’s how we feel about uncertainty that can lead to paralysis. Here’s the crux of it: **the information gap that gives rise to uncertainty isn't important and it will increase the enjoyment of a pleasurable experience** (a great TV show with twists and turns we couldn’t predict, for example).

### How to Deal with Uncertainty
**Be deliberate and disciplined about what information we consume.** Ask these two questions: 
* Is the information even attainable? 
* Do I need this information right now? 
*If either answer is no*, then we need to let go of the search for those bits of information.

We have a natural discomfort with uncertainty and **we need to reframe it. Uncertainty enhances our feelings, both positive and negative.** If we feel negatively about uncertainty, experiencing uncertainty will amplify our negativity. And uncertainty is a fact of life. It isn’t a matter of *whether* we’ll experience uncertainty, but a matter of *when* we’ll experience it. 

### How Uncertainty Helps Us
The important thing to realize is that **uncertainty offers us the best opportunity and circumstances for growth** and that we choose how we operate under uncertainty. If you choose to believe that uncertainty is a positive experience, uncertainty will, in turn, amplify that positivity.

I’m not sure if either strategy will prove effective, but I won’t know unless I try. I would certainly prefer to experience uncertainty with a healthy dose of positivity. I suppose, if all else fails, we can always enact the iconic advice from the classic, “Dead Poets Society” (1989): “Carpe diem.”
