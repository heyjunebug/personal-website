How to cope with imperfection and what it means to have enough and be enough...
<!-- excerpt -->
### Being Human
Lately, feeling like I’m missing a sense of fulfillment and meaning in my work, I’ve turned to the self-help section of my libraries and bookstores. The most popular self-help books share a common message: **all of us are human—the extraordinary visionaries, the ordinary, “average” individuals we encounter in everyday life, and everyone in between—and we are all capable of great things**. Many of the books on career change or skill development focus on debunking the notion that success and excellence in a field results from a “divine” gift or talent. It results, these books contend, from deliberate and consistent practice.

### Success as a Human 
Few consider the comfort that comes from attributing success or excellence in a field to a divine (non-human) element. If anyone can do just about anything with the right amount and type of practice, then shouldn’t we also consider the implications of the converse: **What are the implications for someone who is not successful when you eliminate the non-human component of success?** I think most of these authors would suggest that the people who haven’t become successful simply haven’t put in the time and effort. Are these people lazy? *Do they—do I—deserve to be unsuccessful?*

### Success While Being Imperfect
Our extreme focus on the individual—on human agency—has contributed to what Brené Brown calls “a culture of scarcity.” **We know—intimately, deeply—what it means to never be enough. And without practice and effort to embrace our imperfect selves, we can easily get overwhelmed by the scarcity.** This scarcity thrives in our culture: We sweep shame under the rug and let our citizens deal with it however they see fit, we encourage comparison that further contributes to a widening gap in resources, and our citizens are more and more disengaged from each other and society.

### Affirmations
Many of us are struggling and feel that we’re never going to be enough. I think I might never be knowledgeable enough, strong enough, good enough. Brown suggests a couple affirmations that I am going to try.

In the morning: “No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough.”

In the evening: “I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.”

I find it interesting that even the mention of vulnerability and imperfection makes me uncomfortable. Brown suggests vulnerability is the remedy. I hope she’s right.
