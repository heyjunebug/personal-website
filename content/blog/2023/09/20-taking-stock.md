A pause in my usual routine to take a look at where I’m at and where I’d like to be. It’s been quite the ride diving back into HTML and CSS and dipping my toe into Javascript.

<!-- excerpt -->

## But first, a little context

I plead guilty to starting new journals despite having a stack of many mostly unused journals. There’s something irresistible about starting anew. I can’t help but think, “This time will be different. I’m leaving behind all my baggage and I’ll just start *being* the person I’ve wanted to be all along.”

It’s idealism in its fullest expression. Like I can just erase the past. Like I can just skip the hard parts. Like I can just get fit in 30 days with this *one-of-a-kind*, *totally original*, *“guaranteed to work or your money back”* program.

Spoiler alert: You can’t erase the past. You can’t skip the hard parts. Those programs don’t work (it’s not you, it’s them).

## The web design journey, so far

I began with acceptance. I accepted that I am definitely a beginner when it comes to Javascript. And I accepted that I am not that far beyond an advanced beginner with HTML and CSS because I found myself referencing [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) every 10 minutes or so.

I looked into what would realistically fit into my schedule. On average, I figured I could guarantee about two hours four days a week. (I give myself Sundays off of everything work-related and the other two days are already booked.)

In an effort to embrace a [beginner’s mind](/blog/2018-08-16-beginner-s-mind/), I invested some of that limited time into free resources like [web.dev courses](https://web.dev/learn/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) instead of investing all of that time into cobbling something mediocre together. 

Since deciding to dedicate myself to web design about a month a half ago now... 
* I’ve earned the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. 
* I am through 6 of 21 web.dev’s [Learn HTML!](https://web.dev/learn/html/) course pages and 9 of the 29 [Learn CSS!](https://web.dev/learn/css/) course pages.

To no one’s surprise, learning web design is still a work in progress, and it will probably always be. However, I am glad to have invested time into “invisible” learning—the not-so-sexy work of reading and taking notes on the basics so I won’t have to re-learn them again.

## What this website required

What I discovered in those six-ish weeks was that there’s even more beyond learning and writing code. Things I didn’t know I didn’t know.

These were things like:
* How do I want to create a website? Coding it by hand? With a static site generator like [11ty](https://11ty.dev)? (That *is* where I landed, by the way.)
* How will I store and organize my ever-expanding and ever-growing (hopefully!) collection of *stuff*?
* How will I get this thing online and available for anyone to see? (At the time of writing this, I still haven’t landed on my answer to this question.)
* At what point is this site *good enough*? How often ~~will I~~ can I update it?

It was a lot of web design- and development-related stuff to think about and look into!

## What I still need to do

Admittedly, this section is more for me than anyone else, but I need somewhere to account for the things I need to do before I feel like I can consider it *good enough* and ready for production... and, most importantly, to support making and writing *new* stuff.

This list is *roughly* in order of how I think I’ll tackle these.
* Finish uploading my portfolio “reflections” for years 2014–2022
* Finish uploading past notes
* Finish uploading “how to” guides (aka my unsolicited advice—considering getting the domain unsolicited.fyi)
* Deploy this site... *somehow*
* Create pages for the other collections: portfolio items and book reviews (CSS grid, here I come?)

## The good news!

I’m heading to San Diego for a long weekend. My husband is taking a workshop on [Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization](https://rintalachiro.com/viscero-vertebral-relations-september-22-24/), so I’ll have plenty of time to myself to make sh*t happen. In my mind, it’ll be enough time to cross a few things off that list!

Stay tuned.
