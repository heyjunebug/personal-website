At a recent lunch with a client, we noticed a funny thing: Everyone was wearing shades of black and white. One person—the youngest of us—was wearing green. Someone said it was easy—no matching required. Another said you could never go wrong with black or white—they are timeless.

I’ve been thinking lately: I rarely wear color, why would I use color on my *personal* site?
