I stumbled into the decision to use <code>filter: grayscale(1);</code>, and I don’t think I’ll go back anytime soon. I find it soothing enough that I may even take it even further and make my entire site shades of gray.

At a recent lunch with a client, we noticed a funny thing: Everyone was wearing shades of black and white. One person—the youngest of us—was wearing green. Someone said it was easy—no matching required. Another said you could never go wrong with black or white—they are timeless.

I’ve been thinking lately: I rarely wear color, why would I use color on my *personal* site? This thought comes alongside a concern that unnecessary sensory stimulation compounds the information overload many of us experience and attempt to tune out.

It is so disrupting and distracting it is for me to smell heavily perfumed individuals in a grocery store. And it seems worse after the barrage of noise that comes from working in San Francisco—I’m writing this at the beginning of Fleet Week and the flyovers are so loud you can’t even hear your own voice much less anyone else’s. But even without Fleet Week, it is quite common to hear something disruptive—fire trucks, shouting, beeping—multiple times an hour.

Over the last year or so, I have minimized social media distractions.^[This deserves a bit of a caveat. While I no longer doom scroll any social media platform, I can’t seem to bring myself to delete my accounts and remove myself completely. One day, perhaps.] Now it seems time to experiment with minimizing sensory stimulus as much as possible.
