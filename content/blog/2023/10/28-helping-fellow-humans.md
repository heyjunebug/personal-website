I’ve spent much of the year thinking and talking about how challenging, annoying, frustrating, and just so freaking imperfect human beings are…

<!-- excerpt -->

...and not only is it holding me back from wanting to identify as a fellow human, it’s meant that I haven’t been willing to consider that I might want to help them.

After reading [Anything You Want](/books/anything-you-want/), I've found myself softening and wondering "What would happen if I let go of all that judgment?"

What if I let go of the sense that “humans make their own problems”… and that maybe they should just stop doing that?! What if I look myself in the eye and realize how many problems I make for myself… and that maybe *I* should just stop doing that?!

What then?

Well maybe I’d see that I have wanted to write my story down and to publish whatever complete-but-not-perfect version I can manage… but it’s hard! It’s hard even when you have all the skills to make it happen (on paper). I can’t even imagine if I didn’t have all the skills…

And yet, here I *still* sit. On the journey (I think?) to my first book. It’s hard to tell since this part of the journey looks a lot like the beginning did: lots of enthusiasm, not a lot of words. 

I can’t be alone in this, can I? Maybe we—there has to be someone out there who’d want to do this, too—can do it together… somehow.

But I’m no teacher or expert. I’m just someone who wants to tell my story and give people the opportunity to tell theirs. 

So how do I find them? Then, how do I help them… and me?
