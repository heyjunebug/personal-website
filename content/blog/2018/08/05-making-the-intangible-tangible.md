Of the terms we use to describe the maintenance stage of change (the period of time when you’re working to keep the change you’ve made going)—maintenance, the status quo, continuity, inertia—the only positive one of all of them is probably continuity.

The languages we know make it easier to talk about certain things and harder to talk about others. The words we have and use give us a clue into our values… and how they shape who we are and who we are able to become.

- Are there words you always use or topics you always return to? 
- Do you notice any patterns emerging?
