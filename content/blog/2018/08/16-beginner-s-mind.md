I like being good at things and despise being bad at things. It’s struck me lately that I am especially bad at being a “good” beginner, that is, someone with a beginner’s mind. The “beginner’s mind” is a concept from Zen Buddhism: it is an attitude towards learning that is open, eager, and unencumbered by expectations. 
<!-- excerpt -->

As a beginner, I am rarely open-minded, I am scared, and I have expectations of myself that run so deep, my self-esteem might suffer if they aren’t met. So, I try to cheat the process by reading and researching as much as I can. In the process, I lose even more of the playful innocence of the beginner’s mind.

I want to rediscover the joy and fearlessness of practicing everything with a beginner’s mind.
- I hope to be open and receptive to new experiences and knowledge.
- I hope to be eager and playful when confronted with challenge.
- I hope to learn with no expectations and observe myself without judgment.
