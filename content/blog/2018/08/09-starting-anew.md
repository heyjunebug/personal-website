Rob and I started YogaGlo’s “Foundations of Flow” program, led by Jason Crandell, and for the first time, I believe that practicing yoga is finally going to “stick.” One of the crucial things for me has been shifting my focus from coming to the practice to achieve to coming to the practice to learn. 
<!-- excerpt -->

I’m realizing that yoga is not only a collection of postures, transitions, and flow (breath) but that those things are meant to complement philosophy. Yoga has helped me further develop my moving meditation practice. Yoga—and any movement practice—is the perfect opportunity to learn about, express, and develop the self. So often, I have approached new movement practices because I had specific goals in mind that I hoped to achieve. I set myself up for disappointment and frustration. Since shifting my perspective, I have felt less pressure to achieve and more enjoyment in the experience. For the first time (that I can remember), I’m practicing to learn, to experiment, to play.
