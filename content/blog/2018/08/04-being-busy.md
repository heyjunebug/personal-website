As a society and culture, we struggle with time. I cannot count the number of times I’ve heard friends and strangers alike talk about how they would do this thing that is SO important to them, but they just don’t have the time. There’s a shift in perspective that needs to happen here: what we are really thinking about is how much energy we have.

We cancel scheduled events because we don’t have *the energy* to spend on them or we’d rather spend that energy on something else. We don’t start that new training and learning regimen we’ve been talking about because—you guessed it—we don’t have *the energy* to spend on it. We mistake our energy demands for lack of time because, instead of trying to replenish our lack of energy, we give in to our low-energy state and enter a near-vegetative state of mindless distraction.

We look back on our days or nights and wonder *where did all my time go*? The better question is *where did all my energy go*?
