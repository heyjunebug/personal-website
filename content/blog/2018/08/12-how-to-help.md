It can be very easy for me to lose sight of the fact that we are all so different. When I stumble on things that resonate with me and help me, I just want to share them with everyone. I feel this great, positive energy that I want to gift to the world. I completely forget that what works for me doesn’t work for everyone.

I have to remind myself that everyone has a different context: a different upbringing, a different set of external circumstances (career, household situation, etc.), and a different experience of today. On top of that, just because someone is open to change doesn’t mean they’re ready for it. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve turned down or tuned out perfectly sound advice simply because I wasn’t ready.

The greatest gift you can offer someone is by being there for them in whatever capacity *they* are ready for—perhaps that’s the offering of a physical gift, a shoulder to weep on, a hug, a brainstorming session, or something else entirely. It’s about helping them with what *they* want and need, not prioritizing *what you think* they want and need.
