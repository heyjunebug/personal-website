I’ve always thought that practice was all about repetition in order to perform better. In other words, the goal of practice was to work on your weaknesses and eliminate them.
<!-- excerpt -->

I never thought practice for practice’s sake would ever be valuable. As someone who strives for achievement and growth in all parts of my life, it was a difficult concept to grasp, much less commit to. I have struggled to maintain my commitment to many of my past practices because I didn’t think I had a goal to strive for, until I realized that all practices have a shared goal. 

The goal of all practice is *knowledge of the self* and, hopefully, evolution of the self. Every day, I am striving to use the knowledge and growth I’ve earned through my practices to be the most evolved self I can be.
