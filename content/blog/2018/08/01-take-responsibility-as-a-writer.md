Writers have a responsibility to their audience and to their craft to seek truth and make themselves clear. Words fucking mean things. It’s time to realize that words have immense power and with that power comes the responsibility to use it wisely.

> Words fucking mean things.

Writers, you frame our how we understand our world (our reality) and what kind of world we think we should want to live in (our hopes and dreams). You show us what to focus on: what’s in the frame, what’s in the background, and what’s in the foreground. Help us find the right words and lead us by example: give us clarity, precision, and for the love of all things holy, the fucking truth. Do good, not evil. Tell it like it is: no extraneous modifiers, no hesitation, no style-for-style’s sake, nothing unnecessary—just the truth. 

It requires practice, persistence, and a very thick skin, but I believe in you… in us. We can do it.
