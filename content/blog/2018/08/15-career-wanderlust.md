I enjoy traveling to learn about different cultures (and their foods), but I don’t love to travel in general. I never Google new places to visit and I don’t have a travel bucket list. I’m rarely seduced by swaying palm trees, serene lakes, or the grandeur of man’s greatest monuments. I don’t wish for a taste of another life in another place. I do, however, constantly shop around for different careers.

I think about what it would be like to be a psychologist who helps people with their deepest, darkest shit… or a movement coach who helps people become more fit for their lives… or an artist who creates works that inspire and question. I am a “career tourist,” looking for my purpose everywhere but the one place with the most answers: inside myself. Just as I’m happiest at home because I’ve built a life I love—one where I am surrounded by wonderful humans and creatures—perhaps, I might be able to build a career in the same way.
