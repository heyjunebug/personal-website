Bayles and Orland's “Art and Fear” suggests that what artists learn from other artists is not just history and technique.
<!-- excerpt -->

> What we really gain from the artmaking of others is courage-by-association.
<cite>Bayles and Orland, <em>Art and Fear</em> (90)</cite>

They posit that there is some validity to the “proposition that nothing really useful can be learned from viewing finished art.”

Bayles and Orland have put into words what I've been unable to. I have long been inspired by seeing process work. I have talked and written about my admiration for those who are transparent about the time and energy they’ve invested into creating what looked to be the result of genius and talent. I have found little pleasure or value in viewing completed art without knowing anything about the artist or their context. 

When considering the artmaking of other artists, I am drawn to their courage to make, to persevere, and to share. I hope to gain what Bayles and Orland have neatly coined “courage-by-association.”
