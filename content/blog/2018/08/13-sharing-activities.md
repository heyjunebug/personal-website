What we do for fun or for work does not necessarily correlate to a specific set of values. Just because you meet a potential partner (friend or otherwise) doing the same activity does not mean you necessarily value the same things in a relationship, much less in life. 
<!-- excerpt -->

For example, not all climbers love the great outdoors. Not all climbers even want to get better at climbing. 

The same could be said about any activity or lifestyle: we all come to these activities and practices looking for something and those things are usually not the same for everyone. Even if the goal sounds the same, like “get stronger,” it can still mean very different things to different people. One person might want to be able to lift heavy things. Another person might want to be able to carry things long distances. 

Of course, it’s wonderful to share an activity with a potential or current partner: it offers a “two birds, one stone” kind of convenience. Just keep in mind that these activities offer all of us different payoffs and that we are all hoping to “fix” our imperfect selves in different ways.
