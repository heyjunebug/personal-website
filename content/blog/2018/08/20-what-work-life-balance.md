The desire to find a “work-life balance” has always troubled me because it positions work and life on opposite sides of the scale. It implies that “adding” to one side means you must “subtract” from the other side to stay balanced.
<!-- excerpt -->

My fundamental issue is that it assumes that your work and your (personal) life are separate and that you can even “escape” conflicts and challenges in one by focusing more attention on the other. 

I think there is another way, one that I want to strive for in my continued quest for wholeness and authenticity. I want my work to be my life and my life to be my work, and for them to be true expressions of myself and my values.
