I’ve heard meditation compared to juggling: you have to try not to try. Once you start trying and thinking about how to juggle or how you’re doing, the balls will fall right out of the air. 
<!-- excerpt -->

You’re seeking a state of flow, which can’t be achieved by thinking about it or trying harder. Often, our proudly secular Western culture has a hard time practicing meditation as a practice in itself… we feel like we need to do something concrete—something “real”—and we don’t have time for that spiritual/philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Sitting with just my breath and my thoughts is fucking terrifying—who knows what kinds of monsters I have chained up?

For the first time, I’m getting used to the idea of meditating... and being proud of it. I finally believe that I will be able to embrace meditation as a practice in itself one day in the future and I am very much looking forward to that day.
