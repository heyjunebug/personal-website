I’ve always thought the concept of wabi-sabi was reserved for aesthetics and beauty. Wabi-sabi is closely linked to transience and imperfection—and, perhaps most importantly—the acceptance of those aspects of existence… and their role in experiencing joy and delight.

> _Wabi-sabi_ as the pursuit of excellence without the pursuit of perfection.

I’ve been reading “Perfectly Imperfect” by Baron Baptiste, and I think I’m inching closer to clarity on the nature of acceptance and beauty. Variation—that is, evidence of the human influence—in creation and in performance is what draws us to watch sporting events, attend art exhibitions, read about others’ lives. 

I’ve always sought models for how others pursue excellence without pursuing perfection and how they accept their perfectly imperfect selves. I find individuals inspirations when they rejoice in their humanity and don’t pretend they’ve gone through a perfectly planned progression from goal to achievement.
