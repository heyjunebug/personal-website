If you truly seek connection and trust, before you jump to judgment and conclude something someone did was meant to harm you, consider your reality, their reality, and look for common ground. 
<!-- excerpt -->

Our reality is shaped by three things:

1. our past (personal histories and the societal and global events that transpired during their lifetime),
2. our present (everything that has been happening to them lately), and
3. our future (coming events and their hopes and dreams, or lack thereof).

To build trust and foster your connection to someone, look for common threads and let them share how those threads have woven the fabric that is their life. Only after understanding the fabric of their lives is it possible to interweave your lives to create a connection and pursue a shared goal or mission.
