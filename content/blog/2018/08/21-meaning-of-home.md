What is (my) home? Where is it?
<!-- excerpt -->

I think the usual responses probably refer to physical places (addresses that are standardized so that others can find you there). 

But I think “home” should not only refer to this place that is your physical “base,” which has your stuff and provides you with shelter, it should refer to the space where you are content and supported, where you are unconditionally accepted. 

I feel like I'm home when I'm with my partner, but I would also like to be at home inside my self: my heart, my mind, and my body. Imagine! To be at home, no matter your physical location—I think it would be wonderful.
