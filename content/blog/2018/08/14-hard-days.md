Some days are the kind of days that make you wish you hadn’t gotten out of bed… and that you could just get back in once you’ve realized that it’s one of those days. Those days ask you if you’re a fighter, if you are resilient, if you can forgive yourself. In short, they ask you what you’re made of. Today was one of those days… and tomorrow is a different day: one full of possibility.
