today I had an epiphany. 
<em>maybe.</em> <br />
the point of balance <em>isn’t</em> to even the score or even to even out the good stuff and the bad stuff.

<!-- excerpt -->

the point of balance is to be able to enjoy the entire ride: <br>
the ups and the downs, the stillness and the movement. <br>

balance is found in how we experience and live our lives. <br>
but we look instead to have a balanced experience of life. <br>

how we live is what we must balance. <br>
how we ride our highs and our lows <br>
is where we’ll find real balance and a sense of equilibrium. <br>

it’s about the sensation of equilibrium, <br>
not the tallying of events or actions. <br>

while we can control our actions, <br>
we cannot control all the events of our lives <br>
or the impact of our actions, <br>
but we can control how we listen to our reactions <br>
and how we respond. <br>

balance is found in that space. <br>
in the moments we have to feel and to choose. <br>

maybe balance is found in sensation, <br>
rather than keeping score <br>
with rudimentary understandings of karma. <br>

balance is felt in how we live: <br>
how we choose, <br>
how we react. <br>

of course, this might all be a bunch of bullshit, <br>
but it feels true enough for now.<br>
