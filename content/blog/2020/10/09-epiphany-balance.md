today I had an epiphany. <em>maybe.</em>
the point of balance <em>isn’t</em> to even the score or even...
to even out the good stuff and the bad stuff.

<!-- excerpt -->

<div class="poem">

the point of balance is to be able to enjoy the entire ride:
the ups and the downs, the stillness and the movement.
balance is found in how we experience and live our lives.
but we look instead to have a balanced experience of life.

how we live is what we must balance.
how we ride our highs and our lows
is where we’ll find real balance and a sense of equilibrium.
it’s about the sensation of equilibrium,
not the tallying of events or actions.

while we can control our actions,
we cannot control all the events of our lives
or the impact of our actions,
but we *can* control how we listen to our reactions
and how we respond.
balance is found in *that* space.
in the moments we have to feel and to choose.

or maybe balance is found in sensation,
rather than keeping score
with rudimentary understandings of karma.
balance is felt in how we live:
how we choose and how we react.

of course, this might all be a bunch of bullshit,
but it feels true enough for now.
