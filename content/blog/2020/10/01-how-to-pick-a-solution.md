The best solutions are tailored to a single, specific situation. All other solutions, especially the ones that supposedly work "out of the box" or are "done for you," will always be subpar. 
<!-- excerpt -->

It is effectively the same as outsourcing your work to a robot. The resulting solution produced will work for the "average" scenario, which is, in reality, no one's scenario.

When thinking about the (design) work that I do, I realized that I could provide a template and a list of rules and principles to follow, but the reality is that you would be getting a product that requires a lot more time and investment than you think to really shine. 

While higher-priced "done for you" products provide more guidelines (or documentation) on how to use them along with best practices, they can still be hard to implement without a sizeable investment of time. A lower-priced product only looks good in the hands of a seasoned designer who will make the necessary changes required to tailor the solution to their needs... but at that point, they may as well design and produce the work themselves.

This is applicable beyond the design world. There are plenty of other examples of where fully custom, fully outsourced (to a qualified professional) solutions are far superior to out-of-the-box ones. Workout programs and psychotherapy methods and sessions are just a couple that come to mind right away.

Tailoring is not just important for your clothes, but also for your solutions.
