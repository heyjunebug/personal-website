Change is a non-linear path, one that may not lead us where we think it will. All change begins as mindset work. The more I listen to methods for behavioral change, the more apparent this becomes.

<!-- excerpt -->

More specifically, change seems to be emerge from a three-part process, if you'll allow the oversimplification. 

1. Withdraw from old, tired habits or ways of living and being.
2. Focus on your existing habits or ways of living and being. 
3. Expand your existing habits or ways of living and being.

These also feel like a description of the three limbs of yoga **pratyahara** (withdraw from the senses and living mindlessly), **dharana** (focus or concentrate to invite deep awareness), and **dhyana** (meditate or practice expanding consciousness and awareness).

I like to envision a spiral when we pursue behavioral or awareness change. 

We begin first by spiraling *inward*: examining our current ways of living (habits) and ways of being (identity). Then, we *condense* the spiral tightly—so tightly it looks like a singular point—to amplify our chosen habits and identities. Finally, we allow the spiral to *expand* outward: expanding our habits and our identities. 

The reason I love spirals is that they are not linear and speak to the truth that the road to lasting change (and perhaps enlightenment) winds back and forth, up and down, and sometimes we feel like we're circling back to where we began. 

Chin up, it's all part of the process!
