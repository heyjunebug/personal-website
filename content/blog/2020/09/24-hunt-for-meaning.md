Most of my life has been centered around a constant search for meaning. As early as I can remember, the idea of being useful or contributing in a meaningful way has been paramount.

"Learn math so you can excel in school." Learning math was framed as meaningful to success. "Figure out what you're good at so you can excel at your career." Cultivating talents or natural aptitudes was framed as meaningful to success. Nearly any piece of well-intentioned advice can be understood in this way: as an invitation to explore a meaningful activity.

> Do **something meaningful** so you can have **some kind of good experience**.

Even the thing I'm doing now is a hunt for meaning. I'm writing thoughts down so I can declutter my mind, order my thoughts, learn from what's in there, refer to this later, etc. *Is everything a hunt for meaning and purpose?* In the state of mind I'm in now, I'm inclined to say yes. 

Life might be a little like bowling with bumpersâ€”our emotions and bodily sensations help us course correct as we barrel through life. 
- How does this feel? 
- Does it fill me with joy, energy, hope? 
- Does it deplete me? 

How you answer these questions is paramount to staying true to **your** meaning and purpose.
