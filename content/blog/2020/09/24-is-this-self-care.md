The ultimate self check-in is the act of sitting down, closing your eyes, and tuning in. This simple practice is crucial to connecting with yourself.
<!-- excerpt -->

Whether you make it through the entire sitting or not, you'll learn something about yourself and your current state of being.

- Take a seat somewhere quiet, somewhere you feel safe.
- Close your eyes and listen to your breath.
- Let your body, your mind, and your heart speak to you.
