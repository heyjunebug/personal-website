It doesnâ€™t get easier. Even after you learn more and get better, it still feels hard, not easier. If you're trying to move forward in the hopes of things getting easier, you'll be sorely disappointed.
<!-- excerpt -->

In a world with many possible avenues to take, the one you pursue because you think it leads to a place where things are easier is almost certainly the only wrong path to take. Pursue a path because it leads to meaning not because it leads to ease and comfort.

Pursue meaning, not ease.
