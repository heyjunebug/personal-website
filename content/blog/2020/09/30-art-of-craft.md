Crafting anything—everything—takes time. It takes brainstorming (vision). It takes planning (direction). It takes doing (action and execution). Eventually, it takes reflecting and making changes (revision).
<!-- excerpt -->

The process isn't usually very smooth either. It's difficult to know what needs to be adjusted when things aren't working: is it the vision, the direction, or the action/execution? And even once you identify the issue, it can be hard to accept the changing circumstances.

I'm reminded that nothing worth having is ever just handed to you. The blood, sweat, and tears that you put into crafting something teach you things you couldn't have learned without investing the time and effort. It creates things that stand out. The effort of the work makes it meaningful and worthwhile.

What's worth those blood, sweat, and tears? Only you can answer that. We sometimes wish for someone to just tell us what to do and where to go. But the reality is, that we will never fully invest in something someone else creates for us like we will in something we create for ourselves. We must undertake this journey ourselves. No one else's journey is right for us. 

What we want matters more than what others want for us.
