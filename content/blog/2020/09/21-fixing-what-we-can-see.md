We can sometimes get swallowed up in “fixing” the things we can see: how our bodies look and how we can use them to perform. Even if you’re a professional athlete, taking care of your mental and emotional health is paramount to your success and happiness in life. Being physically gifted only gets you so far.

<!-- excerpt -->

There’s often less concern about mental and emotional capacities: how well we form thoughts, how we understand our emotions, or how we express them.

Working on your ability to focus in a time of distraction is a valuable skill. The world is only getting more complex. There is no better investment in yourself than time.

Managing your responses to your emotions is something you have the ability to change. This isn’t the same as ignoring your emotions or numbing yourself. How you react to your emotions effects all aspects of your life and relationships. There is a difference between getting upset about something and wallowing in your misery.

It’s widely accepted that in order to be healthy we need physical training and practice. Our physical health status can be changed. Why isn’t it widely accepted that we also need mental and emotional training to change?

You can change these things if you practice. You can become more intellectually and emotionally resilient. You can heal your trauma. You are capable of great things. 

Be conscious, be persistent.
