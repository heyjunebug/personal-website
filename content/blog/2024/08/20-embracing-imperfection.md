Nearly three months ago to this day, I suggested I report back in a week. Better late than never, some say, so here I am “a week” later, reporting back.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Twelve weeks and four days, or 88 days, or 2,112 hours, or 126,720 minutes, ago...

I thought...

> * My mind will be *full of possibility, even the sky is not the limit*.
> * My heart will be *full of ease and tension, shaken not stirred*.
> * My body will be *fuller than ever, allowing growth from within*.
> * My calendar will be *full of space, ready to be molded as I see fit*.

Our minds are so sure of our predictions, but in retrospect, I did *not* accurately predict what would come in the aftermath of leaving my job. 

* My mind was not swimming in possibility, but instead, honed in on what was next: building a marketing strategy for a new business. 
* My heart was bursting with excitement, ready and motivated to work on something new and challenging. 
* My body was certainly fuller than ever, but “fuller than ever” *now* has a different meaning, and the meaning will continue to evolve as my experience does. 
* My calendar was not nearly as moldable or spacious as I’d anticipated. 

And perhaps the biggest thing I could not anticipate was realizing that the divisions between heart, mind, body, and calendar are *constructed*. Things do not happen separately in any of these domains. In a way, everything happens in all these domains (and others). 

It’s only my limited awareness that tricks me into thinking events, feelings, or sensations are limited to just one or two of these.

Charles Yu’s “How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe” opens with a fitting quotation:

> is
> at every moment
> alive in us.
