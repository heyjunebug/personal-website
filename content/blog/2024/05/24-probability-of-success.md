In a week, I will have willingly given up a steady monthly income and taken on the unavoidable uncertainty and incalculable risk of building a small business with my partner.

<!-- excerpt -->

## One week, or 7 days, or 168 hours, or 10,080 minutes, from now...

Chances are...
* My mind will be *full of possibility, even the sky is not the limit*.
* My heart will be *full of ease and tension, shaken not stirred*.
* My body will be *fuller than ever, allowing growth from within*.
* My calendar will be *full of space, ready to be molded as I see fit*.

Chances are good that when I read this a week from today, I will find myself nodding in agreement. And if I had to quantify "good" in this case, I would say that in 9 out of 10 universes, these sensations will be spot onâ€”I'm 90% sure.

I ought to report back in a week.

## Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

Probability, chance, *luck* have all been on my mind. How do we navigate uncertainty? (What is uncertainty? A 50% chance? Something lower? Something higher?) How do we make important decisions with limited information with a *real* inability to predict the future?

Here are three strategies that come to mind for increasing your probabilities, chances, and luck:
1. __Wait as long as possible, giving the situation as much time as possible to unfold.__ This strategy increases the probability you will have critical information that *should* impact your decision.
2. __Keep your attention on potential outcomes with higher probabilities.__ This strategy helps you account for fear, specifically, to help prevent catastrophizing, where you focus on the most devastating (and often, the least likely) of the outcomes.
3. __Take action to improve the probability of your desired outcome__ (sometimes talked about as "increasing your surface area for luck"). Going to more networking events increases your chances of meeting a future collaborator, employer, or friend. Brainstorm ways to *do something* about a lower probability outcome or event to make it higher probability.
