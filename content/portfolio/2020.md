<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<h3>North is the Other Way</h3>

How does one begin to describe 2020? It began as many years do, with a New Year’s full of promise and hope. This one felt particularly promising since my husband and I were in a brand new apartment in Austin, TX. Then, quarantine and everything that happened after (including the transition of my long-time design role at the Academy to an editing—proofreading and fact-checking—role as the publication became online-only).

What saved me was a 200-hour yoga teacher training program I started at the end of January. It carried me through the worst of the pandemic. My passion for yoga and for design earned me a role at the studio helping them transition their teaching into a pandemic world.

When our one-year lease was up, we moved back to the Bay Area. “Austin wasn’t meant to be,” we thought.

### tl;dr: Year in Review

* earned my 200-hour yoga teacher training certification
* began consulting and working with the yoga studio to develop their content and new course offerings
* survived the year unscathed (all things considered)

### Lesson Learned
Embrace opportunities when they come because life is a fragile thing with no guarantees.
