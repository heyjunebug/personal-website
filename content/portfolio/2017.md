<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<h3>The Joy of Learning</h3>

I thought I was done taking classes when I graduated. I thought that being out of school was the best thing about being an adult. 

How wrong I was. 

I had long adored “Thinking with Type” by Ellen Lupton. When I saw that she would be coming out to SF to teach, I signed up for a weekend workshop. I confess I had very low expectations. I thought because I had read and digested the information from her book, I had little to learn. 

How wrong I was—again. 

I loved the experience, I loved the [Letterform Archive](https://www.letterformarchive.org/), and I loved meeting fellow type lovers. I signed up to volunteer with the Archive, and continued to do so for years.

Inspired by the lettering workshops, I revitalized my calligraphy practice. I hand-lettered the Save the Date and the Invitation for our upcoming wedding and have continued to practice calligraphy since.
