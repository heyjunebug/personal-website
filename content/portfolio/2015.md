I was tired of work and tired of computers. I went on solo climbing and camping road trips. I went on road trips with friends. I started dating an amazing boy who made me believe in love at first conversation. He reminded me to stay hydrated. I started wearing blue light blocking computer glasses. My boyfriend and I went on road trips, and we climbed together. Something worked: the frequency of my migraines decreased.
