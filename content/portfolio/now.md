### What I’m learning
For the last couple of months, I have been learning web design. I am discovering that while it is frustrating to hunt for missing semicolons (and other troublesome punctuation) in this context,^[Ironically, when it comes to reading the *English* language (rather than a programming language), I *enjoy* a good hunt for typos and other errors in grammar and punctuation.] I appreciate the responsibility and ownership of having misplaced and misused those marks *all on my own*. 

Trying to talk to computers and coax them into rendering what I see in my mind has been a unique and welcome challenge.

### What I’m wondering
This is where I stash anything I think might be interesting. In general, I find myself asking [questions](#questions), formulating [hypotheses](#hypotheses), and clarifying [distinctions](#distinctions).

#### Questions
Is this anything? For discussion.

* Why do we keep moving the goal posts?
* What kind of shame do we grapple with?
* Does one need work? What does a life of leisure look like? What do people fill their lives with?
* People trying to survive in an increasingly hostile society (nature is no longer a threat, so society becomes one?)
  * What happens to morality?
* Why is it difficult to find friends and like-minded individuals?
* Are trust and respect learned or earned? Can they be regained when lost?

#### Hypotheses
Is this reality? For reflection.

* Achievement and accomplishment ≠ meaning
* Society shapes individuals, the elite shapes and preserves social values, therefore the elite (hope to) shape individuals
* Maturity requires the dulling of imagination
* It isn’t possible to have it all, there are always trade-offs
* Self-improvement requires repetition and a tolerance for boredom

#### Distinctions
Is this that? This vs. that.

* Pushing society from within vs. setting up shop outside of it
* Internal vs. external purpose and meaning-making
* Talent vs. practice
* Responsibility vs. freedom
* Education: the ideal version vs. the social institution
* Students, teachers, experts, dilettantes
* Habits vs. choices (humans vs. machines)

### Changelog

* **2021-03-14**: Re-ordered this doc based on how much clarity each section has: Questions, Hypotheses, Distinctions (instead of Distinctions, Questions, Ideas). Changed title "Points of Clarification" to "Is This Anything?" Minor edits throughout the doc.
* **2021-03-13**: Changed title "Things I Want to Write About" to "Points of Clarification." Organized by category. 
* **2017-08-01**: Created. Written presumably to explore in further detail in the future.
