### What I’m learning
For the last couple of months, I have been learning web design. After a long, long run in print design (which continues on), I am finding my way back to talking to computers and trying to coax them into rendering what I see in my mind. I am discovering that while it is frustrating to hunt for missing semicolons (and other troublesome punctuation) in this context,[^1] I appreciate the responsibility and ownership of having misplaced those marks *all on my own*. 

[^1]: Ironically, when it comes to reading the *English* language (rather than a programming language), I *enjoy* a good hunt for typos and other errors in grammar and punctuation.

### What I’m writing
Even while I work on writing new things, I also have [these drafts](/drafts/) waiting for my attention.

### Is this anything?
This is where I stash anything I think might be interesting. In general, I find myself pursuing [questions](#questions), formulating [hypotheses](#hypotheses), and testing or clarifying [distinctions](#distinctions).

#### Questions
For considering and discussing.

* Why do we keep moving the goal posts?
* What kind of shame do we grapple with?
* Does one need work? What does a life of leisure look like? What do people fill their lives with?
* People trying to survive in an increasingly hostile society (nature is no longer a threat, so society becomes one?)
  * What happens to morality?

#### Hypotheses
For reflecting.

* Achievement and accomplishment != meaning
* Society shapes individuals and the elite protects and preserves society
* The difficulty of finding friends and like-minded individuals
* Maturity as the dulling of imagination?
* Relationships: partnerships, family
* Trust and respect: learned or lost?
* Aliens (legal & illegal): belonging and discrimination

#### Distinctions
This vs. that.

* Pushing society from within vs. setting up shop outside of it
* Having it all vs. recognizing trade-offs
* Exhaustion of self-improvement vs. the exhaustion of repetition (and boredom)
* Divine vs. human influences in life
* Talent vs. practice
* Passion (vocation) vs. choice
* Duty vs. freedom
* Education: the ideal version vs. the social institution
* Students, teachers, experts, dilettantes
* Habits vs. choices (humans vs. machines)

### Changelog
* **2022-09-17**: Re-discovered this post and filed it with the other writing I want to revisit an update.
* **2021-03-14**: Re-ordered this doc based on how much clarity each section has: Questions, Hypotheses, Distinctions (instead of Distinctions, Questions, Ideas). Changed title "Points of Clarification" to "Is This Anything?" Minor edits throughout the doc.
* **2021-03-13**: Changed title "Things I Want to Write About" to "Points of Clarification." Organized by category. 
* **2017-08-01**: Created. Written presumably to explore in further detail in the future.
