<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<h3>Is That Light at the End of the Tunnel?</h3>

The world began to fill with hope once again, and so did I. I designed a publication for the Fascia Research Society to distribute at its Congress in Montreal.

In addition, I began to renew old friendships in person and seek consistent work. I became project manager at Studio Hinrichs. The administrative, managerial side of design was a new challenge—one I embraced wholeheartedly.

### tl;dr: Year in Review

* released a print publication at an international scientific conference
* climbed V8 at my local gym again ([see 2018](/portfolio/2018/index.html))
* began working with past Pentagram Design partner Kit Hinrichs
* managed and edited projects at Studio Hinrichs including upcoming book, “Narrative Design”

### Lesson Learned
Relationships make the world go round.
