<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<h3>Heading North</h3>

In 2019, I took two continuing education classes through the U.C. Berkeley Extension. It reinforced the lesson that practice is the key to learning and progress. *Doing* class assignments taught me as much, if not more, than reading about the same topics. What I also learned was that what makes relationships thrive—at work or in our personal lives—is sharing our values, that is, agreeing on how we should live or work.

After [getting married](http://segallphotography.com/blog/2018/04/rob-junes-boulders-resort-spa-wedding/) last year, Rob and I began to plan for the future. We talked about moving even before the wedding. This year, we moved to Austin, TX in October. In December, temperatures dipped below 30, and I thought, “Toto, we’re not in California anymore.”
