After completing the 200-page prospectus, I was recruited by the client and my alma mater, Academy of Art University, to join them as a full-time designer to re-design and produce their newspaper.

The previous designers’ first efforts to create a professional art newspaper gave me very little to work with...

</ul>

During a grueling first two weeks on the job, I learned that even if you are the sole designer on a project, design is a team sport. I had an editor, a publications manager, and the president of the university chiming in on my work. Revisions were requested, not discussed. I had to produce high-quality, error-free work faster than I had ever expected.

That first year of working on the newspaper publishing team, I wore many hats: I wrote articles, I edited and proofed other writers’ articles, and I retouched photos in addition to art directing and producing the newspaper.
