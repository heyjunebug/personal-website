<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h3>Welcome to Real Life</h3>

After completing the 200-page prospectus, I was recruited by the client and my alma mater, Academy of Art University, to join them as a full-time designer to re-design and produce their newspaper. 

The previous designers’ first efforts to create a professional art newspaper gave me very little to work with...

During a grueling first two weeks on the job, I learned that even if you are the sole designer on a project, design is a team sport. I had an editor, a publications manager, and the president of the university chiming in on my work. Revisions were requested, not discussed. I had to produce high-quality, error-free work faster than I had ever expected.

That first year of working on the newspaper publishing team, I wore many hats: I wrote articles, I edited and proofed other writers’ articles, and I retouched photos in addition to art directing and producing the newspaper.

### tl;dr: Year in Review

* designed a newspaper and developed the design style guide
* learned and helped adapt AP Style for the editorial style guide
* produced and delivered 15 newspapers on time
* petitioned for the inclusion of the series comma and lost

### Lesson Learned
Design is a team sport.
