<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<h3>Practice is Everything</h3>

I changed my approach to climbing. What I had begun to notice was that most climbers—including myself—climb with only one goal in mind: get to the top of the hardest problems I can. I never considered that focus on the outcome might be what was holding me back. 

I started to practice instead of constantly trying to perform. I began working on movements and hold types that were challenging. I fell more often than I got to the top. Climbs I had ignored most of my life were pretty much all I tried now. It worked: I got to the top of the hardest climb I had ever done.
