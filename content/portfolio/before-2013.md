<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Schoolâ€™s Out, Forever</h3>

I failed O-Chem twice. I was an arrogant teenager, and thought I was smart enough to get away with poor attendance and even poorer study habits.

I had never gotten so much as a C before, and now I was on academic probation. I needed to get my shit together.

I had always wanted to learn more about how society influences individual behavior and I had always loved drawing. So I pivoted from the sciences, and graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a respectable GPA as a double major in sociology and practice of art.

During the last few months of my time at Berkeley, I sought the help of a career counselor who suggested a career that married a concern about influencing human behavior and a love of art: advertising. I enrolled in and graduated from the Academy of Art University with a M.F.A. in Advertising (Copywriting) in 2012. During my time at the Academy, I worked part-time at a local climbing gym and then interned at an ad agency.

This internship had me exploring and comping creative directions for agency assets...

The creative director of the ad agency recommended me for a freelance design role on a small team working on a 200-page prospectus for the Academy. I worked with them until the completion of the project in August 2012. The project won the SF Gold ADDY in 2013.
