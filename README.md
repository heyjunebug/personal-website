Hi! I’m June. 👋🏼

This site started with [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). I developed the site locally on my MacBook Pro for a couple of months (averaging about eight hours a week) before uploading anything to GitHub.

## Getting started

Run:

```
npm install
```

To run the dev environment:

```
npm start
```

To build for production:
```
npm run build
```
